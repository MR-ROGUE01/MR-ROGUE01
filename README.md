### 🧩 The Story (So Far)

I’m not the “10x engineer”  
or the “coding prodigy”  
or the kid who learned Python at 8.

I’m just someone who started late,  
but decided not to stop.

I break things.  
I fix things.  
I learn things.  
Every day, a little more.

Right now my weapons are  
**C, C++, Python, Git, and Logic.**  
Tomorrow’s weapons will be different.  
But the goal stays the same —  
**get better than yesterday.**

### 🗂 What You’ll Find Here

Not polished projects.  
Not “perfect” code.  
Not copy–paste solutions.

You’ll find **practice**,  
you’ll find **breakthroughs**,  
you’ll find **first attempts** and **second chances**  
and the slow construction of a programmer.

This is my archive —  
the raw version of becoming better.
